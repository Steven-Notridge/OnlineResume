<h2> Noodles! </h2>
<p> What... you've never had Instant Noodles before? Guess you came to the right place then. I'd visited a Chinese warehouse food supplier called Wing Yip. 
    It's a big store near me, that sell quite a lot of general asian foods like a box of 60 duck spring rolls. After walking around for a bit, there was a large section of literally, 
    only Instant Noodles. So I stood back for a bit, and watched as people picked some noodles, adding it to their shopping trolley. I watched for about fifteen minutes, 
    probably looking somewhat out of place, but eventually got a mental heatmap down and picked out some of them for myself. After trying around four of them, I was damn surprised. 
    They were really good! I also went to Sainsbury's and found the 'world foods' section had some Instant Noodles too, and after trying those I didn't think they were too great. 
    So, I decided, I'm going to buy them all and review them. Why? I dunno. But then I also realised, if I do this, I can incorporate some form of DevOps into this too! 
    So I started mapping out the project, making it as complex as I could for the challenge.

<h2> The Results! </h2>
<p> I'm currently planning out and messing with the idea of a WebApp. If you want to see the data, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/Steven-Notridge/NoodlesProject">here</a>.

<h2> The Tech used! </h2>
<p>
    After testing each packet, I recorded the information into a Google Sheet. This allowed me to save as a .csv and use it in other situations. Currently, I've created a Python script which you can find on the link above or on my GitHub.
    If you run this locally, providing you know how to do so, you'll be able to go through the data in an app format. I'm planning to make a local GUI version and to make it an actual App, maybe adding to it in the future with more data.
    Aside from the local version, and as mentioned already, I'm planning to create a WebApp version. I've already imported the data from the .csv into DynamoDB which is hosted on AWS, by using their NoSQL Workbench tool. 
    I'll need to create the javascript to use a FETCH request to the API Gateway, triggering a Lambda function, which then retrieves the data from the DyanmoDB. So far, everything else is in motion, I'm just not that experienced with HTML/JS so I'm having trouble figuring out the FETCH request.
