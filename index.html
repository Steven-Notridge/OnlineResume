<h2>Personal Summary</h2> 
<p>
    After being involved with the Cloud for 8 years, I've been able to build a great set of skills within IT. 
    I have a personal love for scripting, automating anything possible to save time, and focus on more difficult tasks. 
    I'm set on getting into the DevOps culture, as this combines my love for Infrastructure and Cloud, as well as scripting and automation. 
    You can see my work experience below, or navigate to some more DevOps/Developer related stuff at the top.</a>

<h3>YMCA England &amp; Wales - Systems Engineer</h3>
<h4>July 2020 - April 2022</h4>
<p>
    Managing and supporting the users in the office, working remotely and
    located in shops across the UK. I also onboard new users with devices and
    provide a small session introducing them to our environment. I have
    created scripts to automate tasks, giving the team more time to focus on
    other tickets. I also maintained the infrastructure, ensuring systems were
    up to date and created tools to monitor network connectivity. 
    I created a plan to implement a Docker environment for the Developers to test their queries in. But this fell apart, as a migration into AWS was happening at the same time.
    I also performed some VM Migrations, upgrading an AD Server from 2012 to 2019 and also drafted plans to migrate into O365.

</p>

<h3>DMG Media - Support Analyst</h3>
<h4>November 2019 - April 2020</h4>
<p>
    As a Contractor at Daily Mail, I was providing support for users 
with bespoke software, and managing the accounts. I also offered 
assistance with Group Policy and PowerShell to teams outside of my own, 
in order to improve the tools that were used within IT. 
</p>

<h3>Node4 - Cloud Support Engineer</h3>
<h4>July 2018 - November 2019</h4>
<p>
    As a Cloud Engineer, I supported platforms that were hosted on 
Azure, AWS and the company's internal Cloud platform. I worked as an 
escalation point for 1st line Support Engineers, if they were unable to 
resolve issues quickly. The main remote solution used here was Citrix, 
often performing general maintenance and responding to Alerts. 
I started to utilise PowerShell to automate tasks here, for Alerts, User Account creation, Password Expiry, Disk Space Cleanups, Clearing unused remote sessions and more...
</p>

<h3>Matsco Solutions - Support Analyst</h3>
<h4>October 2016 - July 2018</h4>
<p>
    Working towards maintaining a professional service for a 24/7 
helpdesk that operates mostly between the USA, Hong Kong and the UK. 
This involved handing over work, diverting phones and following up on 
anything left from the previous day to other teams in the listed 
regions. Providing effective support to financial clients was a key part
 of this role, as well as good communication between teams within the 
company for further assistance if required. I also assisted with migrating VM's between hosts, patching servers, and creating scripts for clients to further help automating tasks.
</p>

<h3>WorkPlaceLive - Migrations Engineer</h3>
<h4>October 2014 - October 2016</h4>
<p>
    I was responsible for onboarding new customers, and providing them 
assistance with changing from an on-prem infrastructure and migrating 
them into the company's cloud solution. I was part of migrating E-Mails,
 Files and ensuring permissions were kept across systems. We strictly used VMWare to host Citrix and RDP Farms.
