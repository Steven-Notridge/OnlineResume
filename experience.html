<h3>YMCA England &amp; Wales - Systems Engineer</h3>
<h4>July 2020 - Present</h4>
<p>
    Managing and supporting the users in the office, working remotely 
and located in shops across the UK. I also onboard new users with devices
 and provide a small session introducing them to our environment. I have
 created scripts to automate tasks, giving the team more time to focus 
on other tickets.
</p>

<h3>DMG Media - Support Analyst</h3>
<h4>November 2019 - April 2020</h4>
<p>
    As a Contractor at Daily Mail, I was providing support for users 
with bespoke software, and managing the accounts. I also offered 
assistance with Group Policy and PowerShell to teams outside of my own, 
in order to improve the tools that were used within IT.
</p>

<h3>Node4 - Cloud Support Engineer</h3>
<h4>July 2018 - November 2019</h4>
<p>
    As a Cloud Engineer, I supported platforms that were hosted on 
Azure, AWS and the company's internal Cloud platform. I worked as an 
escalation point for 1st line Support Engineers, if they were unable to 
resolve issues quickly. The main remote solution used here was Citrix, 
often performing general maintenance and responding to Alerts.
</p>

<h3>Matsco Solutions - Support Analyst</h3>
<h4>October 2016 - July 2018</h4>
<p>
    Working towards maintaining a professional service for a 24/7 
helpdesk that operates mostly between the USA, Hong Kong and the UK. 
This involved handing over work, diverting phones and following up on 
anything left from the previous day to other teams in the listed 
regions. Providing effective support to financial clients was a key part
 of this role, as well as good communication between teams within the 
company for further assistance if required.
</p>

<h3>WorkPlaceLive - Migrations Engineer</h3>
<h4>October 2014 - October 2016</h4>
<p>
    I was responsible for onboarding new customers, and providing them 
assistance with changing from an on-prem infrastructure and migrating 
them into the company's cloud solution. I was part of migrating E-Mails,
 Files and ensuring permissions were kept across systems.
